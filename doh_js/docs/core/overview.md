# Doh.js Core Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of how the core components of Doh.js interact, from build-time analysis to runtime execution and reactivity. Understanding these relationships is key to effectively using and debugging Doh.js applications.

## Core Architectural Layers & Interactions

Doh's architecture is best understood as a series of interconnected layers, each building upon the last to provide a cohesive development and runtime environment.

*   **1. Resolution Order**: This is the **unifying algorithm** at the heart of Doh. It governs inheritance, dependency resolution, and conditional logic consistently across all major components including **Packages**, **Modules**, **Patterns**, and **Pods**. Its principles (e.g., multiple inheritance, last-wins priority, conditional inclusion) ensure predictable behavior throughout the framework. [See Resolution Order Details](/docs/core/resolution_order)
*   **2. DohPath**: This layer provides **environment-aware path resolution**, creating a stable coordinate system for locating resources across browsers, Node.js, Bun, and the Virtual File System (VFS) in exported applications. It is fundamental to the **Auto-Packager** and **Load System**. [See DohPath Details](/docs/core/dohpath)
*   **3. Auto-Packager & Manifests**: Functioning as Doh's "compiler pass," the **Auto-Packager** is a **build-time tool** that analyzes your project (including `Packages` and `Modules`). It uses **`DohPath`** to find files and applies **`Resolution Order`** to understand dependencies, ultimately generating **`Manifests`**. These JSON manifests are pre-computed blueprints of the application (dependency graphs, file lists, pattern maps) that the **Load System** consumes for fast runtime initialization. [See Auto-Packager Details](/docs/core/auto_packager) & [Manifests Details](/docs/core/manifests)
*   **4. Load System (`Doh.load()`) & `Doh.Loaded`**: The **runtime engine** responsible for all resource management. `Doh.load()` uses **`Manifests`** and **`Resolution Order`** to fetch and sequence resources (JavaScript, CSS, Patterns, `Modules`, `Packages`, etc.). These are populated into **`Doh.Loaded`**, an in-memory **runtime cache** or virtual filesystem. `Doh.Loaded` serves as the single source of truth for all loaded content, crucial for the **Pattern Engine** and **HMR/HVFS**. [See Load System Details](/docs/core/load)
*   **5. Reactive Nervous System: Data Binding & HVFS**: This layer enables real-time updates and reactive programming. The **Hot Virtual File System (HMR/HVFS)** monitors file changes, updates the **`Doh.Loaded`** cache, and then leverages **`Data Binding`** (`observe`/`mimic`) to propagate these changes into live application objects and UI elements without requiring a page refresh. Data Binding can also be used independently for state synchronization. [See HMR/HVFS Details](/docs/core/hmr) & [Data Binding Details](/docs/core/data-binding)
*   **6. Compositional Language: Pattern Engine**: The **Pattern Engine** provides a human-facing DSL for leveraging **`Resolution Order`** to build reusable components. **Patterns** are object templates with multiple inheritance, melded properties, and defined lifecycles. Instantiated via `New()`, they form the primary building blocks of application logic and UI, using resources from `Doh.Loaded`. [See Patterns Overview](/docs/patterns/patterns)
*   **7. Governance Layer: Pods**: **Pods** offer **hierarchical configuration** management for your application. They use the same **`Resolution Order`** principles for inheritance, allowing settings to be defined and overridden at various levels (e.g., environment, tenant). Configuration is accessed at runtime via `Doh.pod`. [See Pods Details](/docs/core/pods)
*   **8. Distribution Loop: Dohballs (Code Sharing)**: This layer addresses inter-project code sharing. **Dohballs** are content-addressed, versioned archives of folders (containing one or more Doh packages) from a project. They are created by build tooling leveraging the **Auto-Packager** and are designed to be easily consumed by *other Doh projects* as dependencies, distinct from primary application deployment mechanisms like Git or Doh Cloud. [See Dohballs: Folder-Based Code Sharing](/docs/core/dohballs)

## Conceptual Flow Through Doh's Architecture

The interaction between these layers can be visualized as a flow from initial project setup to runtime operation and deployment:

1.  **Foundation & Discovery (Build-Time & Pre-Runtime):**
    *   `DohPath` provides a consistent view of the file system, enabling reliable resource location.
    *   The `Auto-Packager` scans project files (including `Packages` and `Modules`) using `DohPath`.
    *   `Resolution Order` is applied by the `Auto-Packager` to interpret dependencies and inheritance.
    *   This process culminates in `Manifests` â€“ optimized blueprints for the runtime.
    *   Separately, `Pods` configuration is structured, also adhering to `Resolution Order` for its hierarchy.

2.  **Runtime Initialization & Execution:**
    *   The `Load System` (`Doh.load()`) uses `Manifests` and `Resolution Order` to load resources (code from `Modules`, `Patterns`, assets) into the `Doh.Loaded` cache.
    *   `Pods` are loaded, making configuration available globally via `Doh.pod`.
    *   The `Pattern Engine` facilitates the creation (`New()`) and operation of `Patterns`. These components, defined within `Modules`, utilize resources from `Doh.Loaded` and configuration from `Doh.pod` to execute application logic.

3.  **Runtime Reactivity & Updates (Primarily Development):**
    *   `HVFS` monitors the file system for changes.
    *   When a file is modified, `HVFS` updates the corresponding resource in `Doh.Loaded`.
    *   `Data Binding` mechanisms (`observe`/`mimic`) then propagate these changes from `Doh.Loaded` to active parts of the application (e.g., UI, stateful objects), often without a full page reload.

4.  **Packaging & Sharing (Inter-Project Focus):**
    *   For sharing code between Doh projects, `Dohballs` are generated. These are versioned, deployable snapshots of specific project folders (containing packages), created by the `Auto-Packager` and build utilities. They are designed for consumption by other Doh projects, differing from the deployment of a full application to production (which would typically involve Git-based workflows or dedicated deployment tools).
